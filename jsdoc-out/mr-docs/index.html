<h1>&quot;Suman is designed to supercede Mocha, and rival AVA&quot;</h1>
<br>
## &#9658; Installation
<br>
<i> => For command line tools:</i>
## ```$ npm install -g suman```
<br>
<i> => For test suites in your project:</i>
## ```$ suman --init```
<h3>Note: you should run  <code>$ suman --init</code>  in your <i>project root</i> after installing suman as a global module</h3>
<p>=&gt; to convert a Mocha test or whole directory(s) of Mocha tests to Suman tests use <br>
<code>$ suman --convert --src=&lt;src-file/src-dir&gt; --dest=&lt;dest-dir&gt;</code></p>
<p>=&gt; to simply install Suman as dev-dependency in any project you can use <code>$ npm install -D suman</code>, <br>
however <code>$ suman --init</code> is the preferred way to initialized suman in a given project.</p>
<br>
# &#9658; Purpose
<br>
<p>The purpose of the Suman library is to provide the most sophisticated test runner in the Node.js ecosystem, with better
features and much more streamlined usage than AVA, Mocha, and Tape. Suman is a first-rate library and we hope you
take the time to compare its capabilities with AVA, Mocha and Tape.</p>
<p>The primary aims are:</p>
<ul>
<li>make tests run much faster by leveraging async I/O and separate Node.js processes</li>
<li>isolate tests by running in separate processes</li>
<li>make debugging your test files much easier; achieved by allowing for running of tests with plain node executable</li>
<li>provide cleaner output, so that developer logging output is not necessarily mixed with test results</li>
<li>add a whole bunch of missing features from Mocha, Tape and AVA, while simplifying the Mocha API and doing
away with implicit globals</li>
</ul>
<br>
# &#9658; About
<br>
<hr>
<p>(disclaimers: Suman is in beta, despite the current version number; Suman supports Node versions &gt;= 4.0)</p>
<hr>
<i>
<p>Suman is a new test runner for Node.js and is focused on high-throughput maximum concurrency asynchronous testing of backend services.
Suman is not designed to run in the browser - it is designed for maximum performance of backend testing.</p>
<p>This project summarily improves Mocha on every level, and also borrows excellent features from Tape/AVA such as the plan features and
the use of t as a singular param to both hooks and test cases. It all gels together quite nicely into a library that is much more
powerful than both AVA and Mocha. The biggest advantage Mocha has over Tape/AVA is the nested describe/suite blocks. These are huge
once you start writing non-trivial tests. <strong>Conversion from Mocha to Suman is automated with this library.</strong> The other advantage of Suman
is that Suman does not require transpilation - AVA does require transpilation - which add a lot of complexity and overhead. We don't need Babel
to add powerful features. Those using AVA or Tape who want something more powerful will find the answers here.</p>
<p>Suman is feature-rich and very fun to use, because it has the same hooks and patterns as Mocha which are quite fun to use and expose the power
of asynchronous programming. Suman is designed to be a direct successor to Mocha, Tape and Jasmine, and to compete with the new Node.js test runner AVA;
it's aim is to be more sophisticated and featureful than the competition.
Suman was designed so that there would be a super simple migration path from Mocha to Suman, but also provide
massive improvements over Mocha, specifically for backend testing. Mocha is most familiar to us and perhaps to you - Mocha was a great test library, but has many bugs and shortcomings
that we experienced ourselves over time, and eventually we wanted a test runner that we could use that was more robust and more streamlined than Mocha,
that was also enterprise-grade. We are experienced Mocha users and know exactly what Mocha is missing (but we will take feature requests from you too!).
Suman is designed for powerful and full-featured testing of integrated and asynchronous networked systems,
and is not currently intended to be used for front-end testing. (Your backend testing framework and front-end testing framework should probably be different if you
want them both to be powerful and full-featured). This library gives you features for backend testing that are not available in other testing frameworks since this
library is not constained by the requirement that it must run in the browser. The bottom line is that all the problems with Mocha were fixed by this library.
If you have a special question, concern or requirement don't hesitate to open an issue to see if Suman has you covered.</i></p>

<p>Suman was written to support Linux, OSX and Windows</p>

<h3>The reasons why Mocha and its peers need a replacement are clear:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Mocha, Tape and Jasmine test files were not run in separate processes (necessary for isolation, speed and independence of test results)</li>
<li>Using Mocha, Tape and Jasmine, not only was everything run in a single process, but all test cases and hooks were also run in series, which takes unnecessary amounts of time for tests utilizing async I/O</li>
<li>Mocha prescribed no solution to the problem of starting up the services necessary to do system/integration testing - using Mocha/Tape/AVA it is up to the developer to manually start those services,
which makes automated testing much more difficult.</li>
<li>Mocha and Jasmine could not move forward with ES6/ES7 features due to certain software patterns used (globals and complex context binding)</li>
<li>a BIG ONE: clean reporting - at the command line, using Mocha and Jasmine, logging/debugging output by the developer would obfuscate the test results, nullifying any advantage of reporting tools. Suman has a simple
trick up its sleeve to allow for 100% clean reporting for any test or group of tests.</li>
<li>Mocha and Jasmine could not have certain useful serverside features, because they were also constained by running in the browser.</li>
<li>Mocha lacked real ability to do true dynamic testing (meaning, registering a dynamic number of it() test cases) =&gt; e.g., make a network call, get X values, create a test case for each.</li>
<li>Mocha had confusing and obfuscated context values (values for 'this'), which we have greatly simplified, allowing for the usage of arrow functions, etc</li>
<li>Mocha, Jasmine and Tape lack some other nice features that are implemented by Suman. For example, Tape's ability to pre-load modules using the command line
before running tests is nowhere near as powerful or easy to use as the dependency injection ability of this library.</li>
<li>Using Mocha, Tape, Jasmine you could not easily pass data to tests, to reuse the same test code for different scenarios; Suman allows you to pass dynamic data
to tests using dependency injection.</li>
<li>cannot call tests programmatically without wrapping Mocha test suite in a function, Suman allows you to call tests programmiatcally, without having
to wrap tests in a function.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suman Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Just works&quot; - no need for addons or plugins, unless you want to write a custom reporter</li>
<li>Stick to Node core modules</li>
<li>You don't need to transpile if you don't want to: <em>as ES6 generators + Promises
can give you the same coding patterns as ES7 async/await</em></li>
<li>Use stream APIs when possible and reasonable</li>
<li>Provide a full-featured, non-dumbed-down API that's easy to get started with, and
intuitive to use over the long-run.</li>
<li>Listen to what the community wants.</li>
<li>Leverage Javascript's strengths (ahem <em>closures</em>)</li>
<li>Don't be lazy.</li>
<li>As Suman is a command line application, we can utilize a more functional programming style</li>
<li>Details matter*</li>
<li>Most Node.js test frameworks aren't robust enough to test mission critical systems =&gt; Suman was written to provide a highly robust test framework
to the Node.js community.</li>
</ul>
<h1>â–º Suman features:</h1>
<ul>
<li>basics:
<ul>
<li>=&gt; tdd/bdd interfaces</li>
<li>=&gt; easy migration from Mocha (it's automated using the --convert flag, see below)</li>
<li>=&gt; extremely powerful, while aiming to be straightforward, clean, concise, consistent and accurate</li>
<li>=&gt; designed with ES6 and ES7 in mind, including Promises, async/await and generators</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Improved mechanics, syntax and semantics </b>
<ul>
<li>singular param (t) is used for all hooks and test cases, in the style of AVA</li>
<li>Pass data from test cases to hooks using the value option of a test case</li>
<li>Pass data from hooks to test cases using the t.data value
(neither are possible with Mocha, and are very much a missing feature)</li>
<li>encapsulation and immutability are utilized much more effectively than with Mocha etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Full-blown concurrency</b>
<ul>
<li>your tests will run much, much faster</li>
<li>suites are run in separate Node.js processes for speed and isolation</li>
<li>test cases and hooks in any given suite can be run concurrently, when using asynchronous I/O</li>
<li>capability to control maximum number of processes running at a time</li>
<li>capability to add constaints to prevent any given pair of tests from running at the same time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Improved reporting </b>
<ul>
<li>using the Suman test runner, you can prevent any logging output from mixing with test reports</li>
<li>Suman includes a standard web reporter that you can use to share test results with your team, using the Suman server</li>
<li>Suman server provides ability to store past test results (backdata) and view test results chronologically with browser to look at trends</li>
<li>SQLite database stores testing back-data and gives you credibility because you can easily share test run results with your team</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Use suman.once.js to run hooks before the test runner starts </b>
<ul>
<li>these hooks can be used to start the services necessary for any given test file to run successfully</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Very simple but powerful dependency injection (DI/IoC)</b>
<ul>
<li>most useful for injecting values acquired asynchronously, such as successful network connections and database values</li>
<li>inspired by familiar tools such as Angular and RequireJS</li>
<li>load any core/&quot;built-in&quot; Node.js module by name</li>
<li>DI is used throughout the library, and relieves the burden on the developer to remember order of parameters</li>
<li>Inject network values, test dependencies and library dependencies
<ul>
<li>the truth is, once you have more than 3 or 4 dependencies (params to a function),
it's easier to design the API to inject them rather than deal with
contingincies, which is why Angular and RequireJS, while having often many more than 5 params use DI, as well as Suman</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b> Test runner tuning </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Add contraints to prevent any given pair of tests from running at the same time</li>
<li>Cap the total number of processes running at the same time</li>
<li>Suman 'once' feature gives the developer the option to run checks to see if all necessary network components are live before running any given test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Easy migration from Mocha </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Suman includes a command line option to convert whole directories or individual Mocha tests to Suman tests</li>
<li>before/after/beforeEach/afterEach hooks behave just like in Mocha</li>
<li>solid command line tools and better grep facilities than predecessors</li>
<li>skip/only also work like Mocha</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Freedom: Suman is not highly opinionated, but gives you powerful features</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Suman prefers the standard core assert Node module (Suman has unopinionated assertions), but like Mocha you can use any assertion lib that throws errors</li>
<li>Callbacks, promises, async/await, generators and event-emitters/streams are supported in any test case or hook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suman design</h2>
<ul>
<li>no globals whatsoever, which were avoided due to the problems they caused for Jasmine and Mocha.</li>
<li>Suman uses domains to isolate errors in asynchronous tests and hooks, and currently this is the only solution to this problem at the moment.
Domains are facing deprecation, and Suman will replace domains with whichever suitable replacement is chosen by the Node.js core team.
As it stands, Suman is a perfect use case for domains, as untrapped errors are supposed to be thrown in test code (assertions, etc),
and the developer experience in this library will be better than any other test library because of the use of domains, as they basically
guarantee that we can pin an error to a particular test case or hook, no matter where the error originated from.</li>
</ul>
<h2>*Details matter</h2>
<pre><code>* we designed Suman with details in mind
* much better semantics, with new standard functions alongside Mocha's 'done' callback: 'ctn', 'pass', 'fail' and 'fatal' are new functions
each with a unique purpose and meaning, and done is still in Suman's API with the same meaning as Mocha!
* friendly error messages, that also get sent to suman-stderr.log for reference
* when debugging, (the debug flag is set) timeouts will automatically be set to 'infinity'
</code></pre>
<h2>We can say with confidence that Suman is the most powerful test framework for serverside JavaScript on planet Earth</h2>
<p>=&gt; as it gives the developer total control and access to a very large set of features, with the explicit goal of being bug-free first, full-featured second.</p>
<h2>Simple usage examples</h2>
<h4>example using ES6/ES7 API:</h4>
<p><i> Suman is as simple as you want it to be; but it's also jam-packed with features that you can use. </i></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
import * as suman from 'suman';
const Test = suman.init(module);


Test.describe('ES6/ES7 API Example', function(baz, assert, path, http){   // this is our root test suite.

    // we have injected some core modules by name (http, assert, path) 
    // we have also injected a module from our own project, baz
    

     this.beforeEach(t =&gt; {
     
       const req = http.request({

           });
        
        
        });
        
        req.on('error', fatal);
        req.end();

     this.it('detects metal', t =&gt; {
         assert(t.moo = 'kabab');             
     });

     
     this.it('ES7 is not necessary because we can achieve the same thing with generators', async t =&gt; {
     
        const val = await baz.doSomethingAsync();  
        assert(path.resolve(val.foo) === '/bar');
         
     });

        const val = yield baz.doSomethingAsync();
        assert(path.resolve(val.foo) === '/bar');

     });

<h3>basic ES5 API:</h3>

<h3>More Suman Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>see:  /examples directory</li>
<li>see:  https://medium.com/@the1mills/introducing-suman-a-node-js-testing-library-20fdae524cd</li>
</ul>
<h3>SLA</h3>
<p>The Service Level Agreement is that Suman will constantly be up-to-date with the newest features available via the node executable.
We will focus on what's in Node and not what's available in Babel or other transpilers. That being said, we will also work to ensure Babel features are also supported,
but we will primarily focus on making Suman completely bug-free when it comes to the latest version of Node, not the latest abilities of Babel or the like.
By the time any ES6/ES7/ES8 feature is available in Node, it will be supported by Suman. We want to emphasize the utility of the option of running things
with the plain old Node executable, as opposed to adding the complexity of transpilation.</p>
<h3>Execution modes for a single test file</h3>
<p>You can execute a test file with the plain <code>node</code> executable, with <code>$ suman</code> and with <code>$ suman --runner</code></p>
<p>Here are the differences between the 3 options:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>$ node file.test.js</th>
<th>$ suman file.test.js</th>
<th>$ suman --runner file.test.js</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>

<td>no</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>runs multiple processes</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>suppress stdout/stderr</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In order to run multiple files, you must use <code>$ suman --runner</code>; the above table
only pertains to running a single test file (usually when developing a particular test.)</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Q: Why dependency injection in Node.js? Isn't it a waste of time?</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Normally it is. Dependency injection is very useful in the browser and is used by both Angular and RequireJS. In Node.js we usually have all our dependencies or we can easily load
our dependencies synchronously on demand with the require function. However, with test suites, it was until now impossible to load dependencies and values <em>asynchronously</em> before registering test cases.
DI allows you truly awesome ability to create and procure values asynchronously before any tests are run, and injecting the values in any test suite you wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Can I use arrow functions?</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Yes you can use arrow functions everywhere <em>except</em> for the describe callbacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Important aside - How is Suman better than AVA?</h3>
<p>It should be abundantly clear why Suman is better than Mocha, but how is Suman better than AVA?
Suman borrows some excellent features from Mocha that AVA seems to ignore, including the ability
to use nested describe statements for more control and preventing the sharing of scope within tests. AVA basically
co-opted Tape and added concurrency. Suman co-opted Mocha, added concurrency, better reporting, dependency injection and
less confusing contexts for hooks. Suman has more powerful facilities for asynchronous testing than AVA due to Mocha/Jasmine-style hooks
and nested describes. Dependency injection ability also makes Suman extremely convenient and fun to use, compared to AVA.
Suman is simply much more powerful and richer in features than AVA.</p>
<ul>
<li>AVA requires Babel transpilation, which adds unnecessary complexity for test environments, and is also much slower</li>
<li>AVA does not handle errors thrown in asynchronous code gracefully</li>
<li>AVA does not feature the nested describes of Mocha or Suman, which limits the expressiveness of the library
tremendously</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, with Suman:</p>
<p>*Suman has nested (describe) blocks which are imperative for non-trivial tests; a simple example is a before hook that you want
to run only for a certain set of tests in your test suite. The before hook and tests would go in a nested describe block.
*Babel transpilation is optional - you can even achieve the async/await pattern with generators and promises alone
*Suman uses domains to correctly map errors to test cases and hooks, which provides a much more reliable piece of software because it can
handle any error that gets thrown, not just assertion errors.</p>
<h3>Extra info</h3>
<p>If you are familiar with Mocha and like both its power and simplicity, you may prefer Suman over Ava,
and Suman provides the simplest migration path from Mocha. As was stated AVA draws more from Tape and Suman draws more from Mocha.
Suman was designed to make the transition from Mocha to be seamless.</p>
<p>** dependency arrays of strings exist so that during minification we can still know where to inject dependencies, that's why Angular and RequireJS have deps arrays of strings - they don't get
corrupted by minification/uglification. But in testing frameworks, it is very unlikely we need to minify, so we can go without the dep array 99% of the time,
and just use metaprogramming with the callback argument list to locate the dependencies</p>
<p>Note that because Suman should be installed as a devDependency, it won't show up as being used in the standard
NPM badge:
<br>
<br>

<br></p>
 <br>
 <b>Looking for open source dev(s): </b>
 <br>
 Suman is currently looking for a full-stack web developer experienced with both Node.js and React to split the plaudits for this project,

 This project yearns for a really excellent web reporter UI and corresponding backend to support it,
 and what we have now is just the beginning when it comes to the web reporter.
