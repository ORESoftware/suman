<article>
    <p>Suman was designed to greatly improve Mocha. It uses the same pattern of nested describe blocks (suites), as this is a good pattern
allowing for fine-grain control of different sections of the same test suite - something which Tape and AVA probably will always lack -
nested describes/suites allow us to organize our tests, create separate lexical scopes 
as well as having different options/settings, and running different hooks in each section/block.</p>
<p>For those who are familiar with Mocha and Jasmine, the most apparent difference between Suman and the former are the fact that there are no 
globally defined functions and that 'this' is used to access the Suman API once you are within the root suite of a Suman test.
Using this makes perfect sense, for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>'this' cannot be reassigned</li>
<li>'this' appears 'for free' and stays out of sight if you don't need it.</li>
<li>We already need some context for the callbacks, so might as well use it for all calls</li>
</ol>
<p>Suman simplifies the way contexts are bound; in Mocha contexts were genuinely confusing, even to those who used Mocha for a long time. The number of contexts in a Suman test suite is exactly equal to the number of describe statements.
This is why you can't use arrow functions with describe callbacks, because describe callbacks are bound a new TestSuite context.</p>
<p>Suman uses the same pattern as Mocha and Jasmine to determine if a test or hook should wait for a callback
to be fired by the developer before exiting the test or hook. With Mocha and Jasmine if your callback function had done as a parameter, these test frameworks would know to wait 
for that callback for fire before a test case or hook was finished. First we will talk about how basic callback
arguments, like done, allow us to run test cases and hooks asynchronously. Along with standard callbacks,
Suman handles returned Promises, generators.</p>
<p><u><b>Mocha</b></u></p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>before(function(done){

// no matter what happens, until done is called, we cannot continue

});</code></pre><p><u><b>Suman</b></u><br>
We use the same pattern, and now have additional callback options, for use with Promises, event emitters</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>this.before(function(done, ctn, fatal){

// if we use done, it's the exact same as Mocha
// the ctn function, short for &quot;continue&quot;, is exactly like done, except it's not an error-first callback, which is useful 
// for fulfilled/resolved promises, event emitters, and other non-error first callbacks 
// calling fatal will bail on the overall test suite, no matter what arguments are passed to it
// if any of done, ctn, or fatal or called, the hook is exited

});</code></pre><h3>example</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>this.before(function(done, ctn, fatal){

 fs.createReadStream('/dev/null').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/dev/null'))
                                                .on('finish',ctn).on('error', fatal);

});</code></pre><p>This keeps our code flat, and for anyone coding Node long enough, knows that these extra functions
along with done will be convenient.</p>
<p>However, we don't need to use callbacks exclusively anymore for asynchronous code.
Promises, generators, streams/event emitters, and ES7 async functions allow us alternatives.</p>
<p>In Suman, just like Mocha, all test cases and hooks are actually operated on asynchronously, and this is because
<code>Promise.resolve()</code> is called on the return value of every callback.</p>
<p><code>Promise.resolve()</code> is used to resolve hooks that return Promises, or hooks that are generators or async functions.</p>
<p>Hooks that utilize streams and event emitters will need to use traditional callbacks. It is best to keep code
explicit in some cases. See the fs.createReadStream/fs.createWriteStream example above to see how callbacks can be used
with streams (all streams are event emitters). If you use Gulp, you can return streams from tasks, and Gulp knows how to handle that,
so that you don't need callbacks. One improvement Suman might make later on is to handle streams more automatically (without callbacks), at least 
if they are fs-style streams. But for now, you don't have to return the stream, and you will need to use callbacks so that the hook
will wait for it to complete.</p>
<h3>What about test cases?</h3><p>Mocha</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>
it('test case', function(done){  



});</code></pre><p><u><b>Suman</b></u><br>
Just like with hooks, test cases have some more callbacks available to them; you don't have to use them all,
but they are available to be injected in the callback if you name them.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>
this.it('test case', (done, pass, fail) => {  

 // done is exact same as Mocha's done
 // pass is analogous with the ctn function in hooks, it is a non-error-first callback
 // fail is a function that will fail your test no matter what it's passed
 // only one needs to be called to exit the test case of course

});</code></pre><h3>example with Promises</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>
this.it('test case', () => {    // we don't need any callbacks, and Suman handles thrown errors inside Promises properly

 return doSomethingAysnc().then(function(val){
      assert(typeof val === 'object');
 });

});</code></pre><h3>examples with Streams</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>
this.it('test case', (pass, fail) => {    

  new MyEventEmitter().startDoingBusiness().on('error',fail).on('success',pass);

});</code></pre>
