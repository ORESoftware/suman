/* advantages of Suman
 *
 * better than mocha, cleaner than vows
 * no globals - no global NPM module - no global variables
 * test suites each run in separate process for speed and correctness
 * each test suite can have parallel components, allowing the developer to run tests serially, in parallel or in combination, as the developer sees fit
 * code inside any test will not run for any test not intended to run when using grep features
 * organize your tests depending on NODE_ENV or command line flags using config files, instead of putting tests in different top-level folders in your project
 *  asynchronous reporting capablities - write test results to DB
 *  3 reasons to use nested describes?
 *  (1) to control parallel flow - nesting in describe can force to run in series
 *  (2) skip/only - allow you to skip whole sections of a test suite
 *  (3) labelling of output - nesting in describes allows you to label and organize the output from your tests
 *
