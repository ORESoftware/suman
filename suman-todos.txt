  need to add transpile/transform block before run block in gantt chart

    d3 gantt chart
    https://gist.github.com/dk8996/5449641

//

  if sumanception level > 1, then we shouldn't write any TAP results
  because stdout cannot be multiplexed, etc.

//
   print test path run if using node x.js or suman x.js
   sometimes I just forget what test I just ran lol

//

  suman-single-process should use vm to run in this context?
  https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_script_runinthiscontext_options

//

 => use suman --view-results, to view HTML rendering of results from last run

//

  need to increment test numbers, as the results come into the runner.

//

  use marker property with @src and @target as well as @run and @transform
  => is @config.json the whole thing that must stick to @ paradigm?

//

  use block scope

   let foo;
    {
      let v = 2;
     foo = v*2;
    }

//

 --dry-run // --confirm

//

  suman --containerize should reference node_modules instead of re-installing

//

  if suman.init() is called more than once and we are not in SUMAN_SINGLE_PROCESS, we should fail right away

//

 create injector and block injector need to be differentiated.

//

    afterAllParentHooks('yes', t => {
      console.log('after all parent hooks');
    });

//

   need to switch out function arguments parsing

//

 include $index file, inject that into Test.create

//

   add flag --auto-pass, which means runner or test always exits with code 0.
   this is useful when the place suman in a CI/CD pipeline but don't want failing to tests to unnecessarily
   break things.

//

const strm = fs.createWriteStream(path.resolve(__dirname + '/../logs/stderr.log'));

  setTimeout(this.resume,2000);

  this.describe('A', function(){

  });
});

//
   create gantt chart - probably necessary to sell suman itself
//

  test-debug.log gets populated for individual tests, but not for runner, even if there are warnings

//

  maybe we should disallow the runner to be used if inceptionLevel > 0

//

   maximum connection attempts => 5
   if client is not connected, we use stdout/TAP to communicate
   it should always be an either or, never send both

//

   we can cross-check the accumulated test data in the child process to compare with the parent
   they should always align, if not we should log a warning

//

  we may only need one tap parser instance instead of so many
  OR - we need to create table results from each test in the runner
  the child should not be responsible for creating the table
  that way there is one source of truth in the runner

//

    If suman inception value is > x , then inherit stdio should be true.

//

  we could pass the file descriptor of the top most suman down to all child tests via an ENV variable,
  and tests could then use a named pipe or IPC to send messages to grandparent/top-level process.

//

  should merge once-post and make-before-exit-once-post

//

  mkfifo - use named pipes or sockets to communicate between suman-d

//

  coverage information should be collected by istanbul at the end of the test (suman.once.post.js)

    //create coverage info
   const tempConverageDir = path.resolve(coverageDir + '/' + String(file[1]).replace(/\//g, '-'));
   bash.push(['cover', file[0], '--dir', tempConverageDir, '--report', 'lcov']);

    // generate coverage reports
    const k = cp.spawn(executable, ['report', '--dir', coverageDir,'--include', '**/*coverage.json', 'lcov'], {

If you're willing to assume non-embedded Linux,
then you can use the test external command, which is part of GNU coreutils.
(test is another name for [ and is a builtin in most shells).
It has nanosecond granularity (up to the precision reported by the filesystem).

/usr/bin/test "$target" -nt "$source"
The -nt operator isn't defined by POSIX, but it's present in many implementations
including dash, bash, pdksh, mksh, ATT ksh, zsh, GNU coreutils test, and BusyBox.
However many implementations (dash, bash, pdksh, mksh, BusyBox — tested on Debian jessie) only support 1-second granularity.

But it would be a better idea to use tools dedicated to this job, such as make.
Running a command only if a certain file is newer than some other file is the whole point of make.

  => see scripts/bundle-chai.js

//

//

 --exec-arg option should work with "suman --no-runner", because we can pass the exec args with our bash cli scripts

//

@transform.sh cannot be respsonsible for sending back target path, because in many cases we will
skip running @transform.sh because "we have already transpiled.".

//

 => need to refactor acquireIntegrantsSingleProcess

//

 should send the stdout of @transform.sh to @run.sh

  @run.sh =>  if "/@target/" matches path, then don't look for @run.sh

//

--inspect-brk instead of --inspect --debug-brk

//

  n.once('exit', cb) in handle multiple processes, cb should be moved into a different file

//

 force TAP reporter for anything with sumanception > 0

//

 the emitter that I pass into suman reporters, something like this:

 var ee = new EE();

 var on = ee.on;
 ee.on = function(event, fn){
    if(process.env.SUMAN_INCEPTION_LEVEL < 1){
     return on.apply(ee,arguments);
    }
 }


//

  we should inject sumanOpts into reporters, instead of using _suman.sumanOpts, etc.

//

 how expensive is it to freeze properties?

//

  ioc deps should be injected only at the root suite
  inject.cb() values should only be injected for non-root suites

//

  each suman process should forward message to parent, to allow for sumanception.
  process.on('message', function(){
     process.send({});
  });

  create an env variable

  if(!process.env.SUMAN_INCEPTION_LEVEL){
     process.env.SUMAN_INCEPTION_LEVEL=1;
  }

  => If SUMAN_INCEPTION_LEVEL > 0, then don't output test results - leave that to the top level runner

use child unref after all children have exited in suman runner

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the parent from waiting for a given child,
use the child.unref() method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not include the child in its reference count,
allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between the child and parent.

On linux you can use taskset to run node with a given CPU affinity.
See this post for information on using the start command in Windows to do the same.

/* advantages of Suman
 *
 * better than mocha, cleaner than vows
 * no globals - no global NPM module - no global variables
 * test suites each run in separate process for speed and correctness
 * each test suite can have parallel components, allowing the developer to run tests serially, in parallel or in combination, as the developer sees fit
 * code inside any test will not run for any test not intended to run when using grep features
 * organize your tests depending on NODE_ENV or command line flags using config files, instead of putting tests in different top-level folders in your project
 *  asynchronous reporting capablities - write test results to DB
 *  3 reasons to use nested describes?
 *  (1) to control parallel flow - nesting in describe can force to run in series
 *  (2) skip/only - allow you to skip whole sections of a test suite
 *  (3) labelling of output - nesting in describes allows you to label and organize the output from your tests
 *
